Halo 3 armors mod V2.7.7 for Halo Online Eldewrito 0.5 +

Place the folder "mods" from the zip into you game folder.

Run halo3armors_INSTALL.bat or use FMM to install the mod. (FoundationMM)

It should work with any mod, don't worry about the order of installation.

It overwrites old halo online armors.

WARNING: If you have installed mods in Halo Online, the launcher will not validate the game and you cannot update the game to future updates.
You need fresh files from the 0.5.0.2 release zip to update.


Missing decals: missing decals. Not a priority, since it would require me to change a lot of tags.

Armor ported, setup and tweaked by dany5639

ALL ASSETS BELONG TO BUNGIE.
Big thanks to all the devs who participated to the Halo Online modding history.
Special thanks to Shockfire and Camden for the amazing TagTool and many custom commands.
Thanks to MDGZ for fixing the main bump map, which helped me understand what i was doing completely wrong about bumpmaps.
Thanks to FishPhd for a really nice armor changer (Eldewrito Launcher). 



Extras:
default ho armor part name = halo 3 armor part name
air_assault = MarkVI  
stealth = CQB  
renegade = EVA  
nihard = Recon  
gladiator = EOD  
mac = Hayabusa  
shark = Security  
juggernaut = Scout  
dutch = MarkV  
chameleon = Rogue  
halberd = ODST  

If the installer fails, send logs/h3armors.log to reddit.com/user/dany5639

Tweaks are still to be made, but considering i put more than 200 hours in this mod, i doubt i'll keep going for long. I'll wait for a TagTool command to directly port the complete shaders from Halo 3.
