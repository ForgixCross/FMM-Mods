Bugs:

Monitor (000025F4)
	- Radar blips are using the spartan globals.
	- The scoreboard is still distorted.
		- If I can find a way to show a different CHDT for the editor I can use the distort override.

Sandbox (000012C1)
	- The crosshair shouldn't be centered. This is making scaling the binoculars a difficulty.

Spartan (00000C1E)

Weapon CHDT's
	- The pickup weapon widget is incorrect. this should be handled by the weapon tag, like the out of ammo text.
		- This is also breaking the dual weild pickup text, and presumably the take from ally text.

Equiptment CHDT's
	- They don't show.

Scoreboard (000012BD)
	- Flag notifications are lacking icon animations.

Globals CHGD
	- VIP / Objective Waypoints are broken.

Fonts
	- The conduit 32 font lacks an infinate ammo symbol! This breaks everything!
