For those who prefer to install the mod using tag files, I've created the batch file below to exctract them.
Make sure to install the halo 3 HUD on a clean build of ED.
Then, to install, delete all of the files in the "scripts" folder, and move the "h3mods\h3hud\extras\extract tags\tags" to the "h3mods\h3hud\tags" folder.
