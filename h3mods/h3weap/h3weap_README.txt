**Halo 3 base weapons mod pack V1.1.0 for any Eldewrito version (any HO MS23 build)**  
After 150 hours of sweat and tears, here's my visual mod for Eldewrito, base Halo 3 weapons.  
  
**LATEST UPDATE:**  
- Fast installer and optimised installation.  
- Attempt to fix Lockout compatibility.  
- Alternative version (for users with a different locale) always updated to latest version.  
- Added a few sounds.  
  
**List of weapons:**

**WARNING**: you need 3 files from Halo 3 disc/iso/download: **salvation.map, shared.map and mainmenu.map**  
Put those files in Halo Online/mods/tagmods/h3mods/h3weap/h3maps folder. These files are only needed to port the models.  
If you don't have those files or they aren't the correct version, the installer will simply stop.  
- Replaces old Halo Online weapons.  
- You can easily customize the variants skin and colors. Check the cmds text file, i commented most customizable values. Use the "updateOnly" bat to just update the weapons.  
- Fully compatible with [Halo 3 armors pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloOnline/comments/467hkz/halo_3_armors_mod_v272_video/)  
- It's cosmetic so only you see these models. This pack won't be part of official Eldewrito for many reasons.  
- All assets belong to Microsoft, Bungie.  
  
**To Do:**  
- Add more weapons
- Remove the Halo 3 .map files dependency (lots of manual work for now, i'm waiting for a command for tagtool)
- Fix Beam Rifle animations
- Shotgun still looks wierd, i'll have to bugger MDGZ for textures
- Unflip textures
