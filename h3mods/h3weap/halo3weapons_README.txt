Just unzip the mod in your main folder.
It should look like: Halo/mods/tagmods/h3mods/h3weap/Halo3weapons_INSTALL.bat

Use FMM to install the mod. (FoundationMM)
(or Halo3weapons_INSTALL.bat as last resort)


**Halo 3 base weapons mod pack V1.2.2 for any Eldewrito**
After 200 hours of sweat and tears, here's my visual mod for Eldewrito, base Halo 3 weapons.

**LATEST UPDATE:**
- FMM support, improved shaders.

**WARNING**: BACKUP YOUR MAPS FOLDER as the updater CANNOT update modified files if you use the .Bat instead of FMM.
- Replaces old Halo Online weapons.
- Fully compatible with other mods such as the [Halo 3 armors pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloOnline/comments/467hkz/halo_3_armors_mod_v272_video/)
- It's cosmetic so only you see these models. This pack won't be part of official Eldewrito for a few reasons:
--- There's no system to change between the two packs ingame, they just cannot coexist.
--- The pack is not finished, roughly half the weapons are done.
--- They would need ported shaders, and not shaders that i "made" up.
--- Not everyone wants to go back to boring old low poly halo 3 weapons.

**List of weapons:**
Battle Rifle
Assault Rifle
Sniper Rifle
SMG
Magnum
Shotgun
Beam Rifle
Rocket Launcher
Spartan Laser
Fuel Rod

**To Do:**
- Fix Beam Rifle animations (requires custom animations, which we don't have a tool for)
